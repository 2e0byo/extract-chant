#+Title: Extract Chant from scanned Chantbooks

* Overview

Here is some code to take an image, rotate it and split it into lines.
If you tell it too, it will make sure those lines contain four-line or
five-line stave.  It’s designed for converting scanned chantbooks or
music books into sequentially named image which can then be included
in a LaTeX document with something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX
\newcommand{\pnglines}[2]{%
  % Include a lot of lines of chant as individual pngs
  % #1 = preface
  % #2 = range
  \makeatletter
  \newcount\i
  \i=0
  \loop\ifnum\i<#2
  \advance\i by 1\relax
  \noindent\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./chants/{#1\two@digits{\the\i}}.png}
  \repeat
  \makeatother
}
#+END_SRC

Can you tell I can’t see the point in LaTeX looping macros? ;)

  Python, cv2, numpy
